# McShooter
A short POC where you play as a 3d shooter trying to get rid of nasty bats, see how long you survive! Rack up your score!


First ever project in Godot, borrowed the assets form a public online archive, coded all by myself following a bunvh of tutorials on YT! Hope you enjoy!

Aim:
WASD to mobe LMB to shoot, SURVIVE! Try see how many points you can rack up in the meantime!
